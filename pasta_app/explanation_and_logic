Step-by-Step Implementation
Define the Pasta Interface:

This will include methods for setting the type of pasta, sauce, topping, and dressing.
Implement Concrete Pasta Classes:

Implement different types of pasta, such as Spaghetti, Penne, and Fettuccine.
Create a Pasta Factory Interface:

Define an interface for creating pasta.
Implement Concrete Pasta Factories:

Implement factories for creating each type of pasta.
Use the Factory Method in the Application:

Create an application class to use the factories to create pasta objects.



Explanation
Pasta Interface: Defines the methods for setting the sauce, topping, and dressing, and for getting the details of the pasta.
Concrete Pasta Classes: Implementations for specific types of pasta (Spaghetti, Penne, Fettuccine).
Pasta Factory Interface: Abstract factory interface with a method to create pasta.
Concrete Pasta Factories: Specific factories for creating each type of pasta.
PastaCookingApp: Uses a factory to create pasta and set its properties.
This approach ensures that the creation of pasta types is flexible and adheres to the Factory Method pattern, promoting scalability and ease of maintenance.
